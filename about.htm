        Thanks for stopping by! My name is Parker Seegmiller, I’m an aspiring Data Scientist.
        Currently I’m in my last year as an undergraduate Statistics major at
        Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I maintain this site as a
        data science/machine learning portfolio. I thought about using a templated site
        and just buying my domain name but I’m the kind of person who enjoys learning
        anything about anything, so I built this static site from scratch.
        You’ve seen by now that I am <em>not</em> a web developer, but hopefully
        you’ve found what you came for by now, whatever that is.
        If you’re reading this you obviously would like to know a bit about me,
        so I’ll try to hit the important parts.
        <br/><br/>
        I defended my first thesis at the age of six. My first grade teacher noticed
        I was getting bored during class (probably <em>not</em> because I was too
        intellectually advanced as a child, more likely because I was distracted,
        thinking about playing Pokemon Sapphire during recess), so she contacted
        my mother and assigned me to write a research paper. The topic of my first
        research project?
        <br/><br/>
        Helicopters.
        <br/><br/>
        I rented and read books from my school library. I built a wooden prototype of
        a helicopter with my dad. I wrote a single page on the history of the helicopter,
        then gave a presentation in front of my class. There is a video of me holding
        a picture book above my head while reading from my paper, like a southern
        preacher waving a bible around. Using my Casio calculator watch as a
        reference, I even stood on a chair for 20 seconds (in complete silence,
        for whatever reason) to demonstrate the height and time of the Wright
        brothers' first flight in 1907.
        <br/><br/>
        My mom recently showed me the video of that presentation and I realized
        that is probably when I first began to develop my now-immense passion for
        research. I love learning. I love knowing things. I strongly believe
        that attaining knowledge is among the worthiest pursuits of humankind.
        <br/><br/>
        Since December 2019 I’ve been married to my best friend, Candice Day.
        She is a mathematics educator who shares my belief in the power of learning.
        She has devoted her whole life to helping young people succeed.
        I admire her deeply. Together we enjoy long walks, hiking, playing
        classic Nintendo games from our childhood (e.g. Animal Crossing and
        Pokemon Sapphire), frequenting our favorite arcades, cooking (mostly
        Kraft mac’n’cheese, though when we do venture out I think we do pretty well),
        binging sitcoms, and living. I love you, Can.
        <br/><br/>
        In 2018 on a plane I watched the Amazon documentary “Human Flow,”
        which provides a compelling insight into the world’s growing refugee crisis.
        When we landed I pulled out my phone and learned that there are somewhere
        between 25,000-50,000 refugees in Salt Lake City (where I lived at the time),
        with over 1,000 arriving every year. Since then I’ve tried to do what I can.
        I started as a volunteer ESL (English as a Second Language) reading tutor
        at an elementary school in the school district where most resettled refugees
        live. Since then I’ve done many things, including most recently serving
        from June 2019 to June 2020 as a volunteer youth mentor with CCSU
        (Catholic Community Services of Utah), one of only 2 refugee resettlement
        agencies in Utah.
        <br/><br/>
        My main career goal is to always be learning something new.
        To that end, upon graduation in April 2021 I plan to begin a PhD program
        in Computer Science, specifically in Machine Learning. I’m interested in
        NLP machine learning models, metalearning techniques and autoML, supervised
        and semi-supervised learning methods, and feature engineering.
