      My name is Parker Seegmiller.
      I'm a Senior undergraduate student studying Statistics, Computer Science,
      and Mathematics at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I'll graduate in April of 2021;
      I'll be pursuing PhD candidacy in Machine Learning upon graduation.<br/><br/>
      This summer I'm working as a Data Science at Aetna, a CVS Health Company.
      For the past year I've been working as a research assistant under Dr. Tamara Masters,
      PhD, helping to analyze and design  a variety of studies involving Multilinear and Logistic
      Regression models, LDA Topic Modeling in NLP, GloVe word vectorization in NLP,
      Hierarchical Linear Models, and several other advanced statistical and machine learning methods
      in real-world applications. My resume details some of my other experience, you can find it on this site. <br/><br/>
      I'm not a web developer (if that wasn't obvious to you already), but I wanted a space to be able to
      store, publish, and share my personal data science projects. I choose to work on interesting projects
      in my spare time, mostly from Kaggle or other types of competitions. I'm interested specifically in
      NLP methods as they apply to Machine Learning techniques. If you have questions or advice or for any
      other reason you'd like to reach out,
      please message me on LinkedIn (linked below)! I appreciate you taking the time to come see my work!
