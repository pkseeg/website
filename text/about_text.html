Thanks for stopping by! My name is Parker Seegmiller, I’m an aspiring Data Scientist.
Currently I’m in my last year as an undergraduate Statistics major at
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I maintain this site as a
data science/machine learning portfolio. I thought about using a templated site
and just buying my domain name but I’m the kind of person who enjoys learning
anything about anything, so I built this static site from scratch.
You’ve seen by now that I am <em>not</em> a web developer, but hopefully
you’ve found what you came for by now, whatever that is.
If you’re reading this you obviously would like to know a bit about me,
so I’ll try to hit the important parts.

My main career goal is to always be learning something new, and I have always loved research.
To that end, upon graduation in April 2021 I plan to begin a PhD program
in Computer Science, specifically in Machine Learning. I’m interested in
NLP approaches to machine learning models, metalearning techniques and autoML, supervised
and semi-supervised learning methods, and feature engineering.

Since December 2019 I’ve been married to my best friend, Candice Day.
She is a mathematics educator who shares my belief in the power of learning.
She has devoted her whole life to helping young people succeed.
I admire her deeply. Together we enjoy long walks, hiking, playing
classic Nintendo games from our childhood (e.g. Animal Crossing and
Pokemon Sapphire), frequenting our favorite arcades, cooking (mostly
Kraft mac’n’cheese, though when we do venture out I think we do pretty well),
binging sitcoms, and living. I love you, Can.

In 2018 on a plane I watched the Amazon documentary “Human Flow,”
which provides a compelling insight into the world’s growing refugee crisis.
When we landed I pulled out my phone and learned that there are somewhere
between 25,000-50,000 refugees in Salt Lake City (where I lived at the time),
with over 1,000 arriving every year. Since then I’ve tried to do what I can.
I started as a volunteer ESL (English as a Second Language) reading tutor
at an elementary school in the school district where most resettled refugees
live. Since then I’ve done many things, including most recently serving
from June 2019 to June 2020 as a volunteer youth mentor with CCSU
(Catholic Community Services of Utah), one of only 2 refugee resettlement
agencies in Utah.
